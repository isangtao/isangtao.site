Vancouver, Canada Area\n\
Seymour Healthcare is Western Canada’s largest private medical clinic. Seymour Healthcare partnered with the BC Ministry of Health, Providence Healthcare and St. Paul’s Hospital to build an Urgent Primary Care Center in downtown Vancouver containing urgent care, primary care, lab, diagnostic imaging and pharmacy all under one roof. When I joined the team in September 2018, Seymour was already behind the proverbial '8 Ball' to have the clinic open by the end of the year as was committed to the Ministry of Health (an extremely tight schedule). My role was to work with IT vendors, executive and clinical stakeholders to define the new clinical workflows for each department, implement and test each corresponding IT system and train end users before go-live. These systems were:\n\
• Electronic Health Record (Intrahealth Profile)\n\
• Lab (Sunquest)\n\
• Radiology Imaging (Intelerad)\n\
• Pharmacy (Telus Kroll)\n\
All systems went live prior to the end of 2018!\n\
